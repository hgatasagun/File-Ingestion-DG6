- Try different methods of file reading eg: Dask, Modin, Ray, pandas and present your findings in term of computational efficiency
- Perform basic validation on data columns : eg: remove special character , white spaces from the col name
- As you already know the schema hence create a YAML file and write the column name in YAML file. --define separator of read and write file, column name in YAML
- Validate number of columns and column name of ingested file with YAML.
- Write the file in pipe separated text file (|) in gz format.
